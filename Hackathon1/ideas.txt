Ideas:

Timer to suggest you take a break

MDN time tracker?
touch grass!!!!!
reccomend stretches or link video / picture of stretch / break reccomendations
cat pops up to tell you to take a break
feed the cat?

Basic Functionality:
//recogonize that you are on mdn
//while mdn is open, start timer
//recognize any mdn tab using recognize on the manifest.json
???main.js will track time that any mdn has been open
???persistent time so timer is not reset if mdn has been closed
once a certain amount of time has been reached, have pop up on screen with two options:
    - "Take Break": would take user to a youtube video
    - "Reset Time and Keep Coding": would start timer over again
give user the option to choose time limit in settings



Stretch Ideas:
snooze option for dedicated programmers
cat person / dog person setting
sound or music plays when timer is up
visual timer
